stuff needed : mpmath, discord.py
what it does: the bot have lots of features such as moderation, logging and fun commands.
If wanted you can unload certain features, I will improve that later.
This project is very undeveloped, as it is a test project, and serves no actual purpose and SHOULDNT be used
as a actual bot, instead as a... maybe example to learn simple stuff of, if you dont have any actual experience, and want something to learn off.

To contact me about this DM me on discord: n.r.n
